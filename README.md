### Project Introduction
It's the final group project out of [CODEPATH](https://codepath.com/)' IOS program, built with my teammate Sophia Feng, Kimberly Toy. Both of them are my co-workers from Pinterest. ImageJourney is an iOS journaling app that makes it easy for you to document and share your travel adventures. 

### Background Story
Have you ever experienced trying to upload your best travel photos to a variety of platforms; Instagram, then FB, then Pinterest? Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to have a social travel journal app that lets users save and share memories and experiences? We created ImageJourney as an easy way to record and share travel photography, memories, and snippets all in one app. 

### Instruction
- pod install
- open imagejourney.xcworkspace/
